# dush
 A simple shell written in C. This shell is only being made as an exercise and should not be used as a real shell as many important features are missing.

**NOTE**: The project is being developed on Windows. The Linux version may be behind in some features.

## Building
 The build is done by a single build script. On Windows, run `build.bat` in a Developer Command Prompt. On Linux, simply run `build.sh`.
